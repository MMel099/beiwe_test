## Project name
Beiwe

## Description
This repository contains documentation and code examples that are applicable to various parts of the Beiwe platform. This repository was created in June 2018. The idea is that the Python functions that can be used to download and process Beiwe data are in the `code` directory, many of them in the `utils.py` module, and the Jupyter notebooks demonstrating their use are in the `notebooks` directory. Some of the code, whether run in a shell or Jupyter notebook, will require setting up a virtual Python environment. More details on that are available [here](https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe/wiki/Using-mano). Note that there is another repository for [statistical analyses](https://github.com/onnela-lab/Beiwe-Analysis) although we may merge these repositories at some point. For documentation of Beiwe back-end, [start here](https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-backend/wiki).
